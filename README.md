# Purpose

This repo provides a mirror of the [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)
[Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).
This is necessary because CISA's site is not reachable from my integration server.

The mirrored catalog is available here:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d1450bb1-3cbe-42f2-9be8-555ab16ab6a9/kev-mirror/main/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json`
